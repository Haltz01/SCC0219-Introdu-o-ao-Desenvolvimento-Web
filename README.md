## Overview 

This is a website developed for "SCC0219 - Introduction to Web Development" at the University of São Paulo (USP). Using Node.js, Bootstrap and the usual web development stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript), this is a website for a (fake) store that sells eggs (the most impressive and exotic ones!).

For now, we're also using React.js, but we'll change for Vue.js in the future (this is a project requirement).

## Requirements
_// TO DO: The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation._

Don't forget:
- The functionalities you are going to implement.
- Navigation diagram for your application linked to the screen mockups. This link can be just the name of the mockup (i.e. Mockup1, Mockup2, etc) or an HTML link.
- The information you are going to save in the server (no need to decide how that information will be saved).


## Project Description
_// TO DO: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here._

## Comments About the Code
_// TO DO: Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice_

## Test Plan
_// TO DO: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, jUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used_

## Test Results
_// TO DO: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used_

## Build Procedures
_// TO DO: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more)._
### First milestone
For now, to build and run the project, there's a standard guide [here](https://github.com/daltonsato/SCC0219-Introdu-o-ao-Desenvolvimento-Web/blob/master/frontend/README.md).

You must have `node.js` installed on your machine. To download and install it, check [the official Node.js page](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js will install the NPM (Node Package Manager).

As an alternative to the standard guide, if you are using Linux, what you can do is:
1. Inside `/frontend`, run `npm install` to install all dependencies from the project (a folder `node_modules` will be created)
2. Run `npm start` inside `/frontend` and you're done!
3. Wait until the development server is up (check your terminal) and then visit `http://localhost:3000/`.

_Obs.: for Windows, you can use WSL and follow these steps.

The pages that exist for now are: 
1. Homepage (source code [here](https://github.com/daltonsato/SCC0219-Introdu-o-ao-Desenvolvimento-Web/tree/master/frontend/src/pages/Homepage))
2. ShoppingCart (source code [here](https://github.com/daltonsato/SCC0219-Introdu-o-ao-Desenvolvimento-Web/tree/master/frontend/src/pages/ShoppingCart))
3. Store (source code [here](https://github.com/daltonsato/SCC0219-Introdu-o-ao-Desenvolvimento-Web/tree/master/frontend/src/pages/Store))

You can check the design for other pages in `mockup.pdf` and a flow diagram (indicating the navigation flow) in `flowDiagram.pdf`.
