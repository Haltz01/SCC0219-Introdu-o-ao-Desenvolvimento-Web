## Overview 

This is a website developed for "SCC0219 - Introduction to Web Development" at the University of São Paulo (USP). Using Node.js, Bootstrap and the usual web development stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript), this is a website for a (fake) store that sells eggs (the most impresive and exotic ones!).

## Requirements
_// TO DO: The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation._

Don't forget:
- The functionalities you are going to implement.
- Navigation diagram for your application linked to the screen mockups. This link can be just the name of the mockup (i.e. Mockup1, Mockup2, etc) or an HTML link.
- The information you are going to save in the server (no need to decide how that information will be saved).


## Project Description
_// TO DO: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here._

## Comments About the Code
_// TO DO: Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice_

## Test Plan
_// TO DO: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, jUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used_

## Test Results
_// TO DO: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used_

## Build Procedures
_// TO DO: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more)._

## Problems
_// TO DO: List any major problems you had._

## Comments: 
_// TO DO: Any comments you wish to add._
